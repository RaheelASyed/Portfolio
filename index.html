                    <p>
                        My name is Raheel Syed. I grew up in Northern Virginia, and I am currently attending the
                        University of Virginia (UVA). I always wanted to become an architect. However, I also loved
                        Computer Science. I searched for career fields that could combine my interests and found UX/UI
                        Design. I used some free tutorials on YouTube to learn about UX/UI Design Tools and how to go
                        about making a website design. After learning the basics, I completed a Google UX/UI Design
                        Certificate on Coursera was lengthy, but it gave me the courage to start designing websites
                        independently. Some of my hobbies include going to Car Shows, playing Badminton, and making
                        Legos.

                    <p>
                        I am studying Computer Science and Economics at the University of Virginia. Some relevant
                        courses I have completed are Data Structures and Alogrithms 1 (CS 2100), Discrete Math and
                        Theory 1 (CS 2120), Computer Systems and Organizations 1 (CS 2130), and Intermidiate
                        Microeconomics (ECON 3100). I joined a club called Project Code where students can propose
                        project ideas and other students can join them based on their interest. I also joined the
                        Muslim Students Association and Pakistani Students Association to meet more people who share a
                        common identity with me and go to fun events.

                    <h5>CliniVision<span> - Project Code</span></h5>
                    <p>
                        At UVA, I joined a club called Project Code, where students can propose
                        project ideas, and other students can join them based on their interests. I joined a Project
                        called CliniVision, where the goal is to create a website that can analyze X-ray images and
                        use AI to identify fractures and other issues. I became the front-end team lead and taught
                        my team everything I learned about Web Design. We worked together to make wireframes
                        for each page and create a beautiful high-fidelity website prototype. Unfortunately, the student
                        running the team became occupied with other commitments, so the team was
                        disbanded. However, I plan to join another project in the future and complete it.
                        My time as the front-end team lead was unforgettable. No one on my team has prior experience in
                        Web Design, but they were all willing to learn. Everyone had different majors and backgrounds,
                        including one member who was a master's student. Leading and teaching my diverse team helped me
                        become better at clarifying concepts by explaining them based on what they know and understand.

                    <p>
                        Weblems is a startup company, a collaborative effort between my brother, two other UVA students,
                        and myself. As a UX/UI Designer, I play a crucial role in assisting the CTO with creating Figma
                        designs for clients and publishing them using WordPress.
                        Designer and I assist the CTO with making Figma designs for clients and publishing them through
                        WordPress. An important lesson the CTO taught me is not to "reinvent the wheel." He showed me
                        where I could see professional website designs on Envato Elements and Dribbble and told me that
                        instead of designing from scratch, I could use their designs as inspiration and tweak them as
                        needed. This has tremendously aided me in creating website designs more quickly.
                        It has also improved my design skills in general since I am constantly absorbing how
                        professional website designs look and function and apply what I learned to my designs.

                    <p>
                        My Brother introduced me to his friend who works in full-stack development and told him that I
                        was trying to get more into the UX/UI Design field. He told me he needed assistance on a website
                        he was creating called College Marketplace, where college students could buy and sell things to
                        each other. I enthusiastically accepted his offer and began assisting him by advising him on
                        his design and creating different iterations for pages. I also taught him things I learned from
                        online courses, such as making variables for colors in Figma and using auto layouts. One
                        specific feedback
                        I recall giving is when he first showed me his home page, which was full of carousels for
                        each category. I told him that the design was too cluttered and repetitive. We
                        worked together to devise a solution where there is only one carousel for choosing the category
                        of items, and items would be displayed under it. This experience helped me improve at giving
                        helpful, constructive feedback and taught me how to iterate on a design to improve it.

                    <h5>UX/UI Designer<span> - PolyUno</span></h5>
                    <p>
                        I joined PolyUno as an intern after gaining an interest in web design. PolyUno is a SaaS
                        company, so I thought it was perfect to explore the field more. The CEO provided me
                        with free online courses that helped me learn Figma, HTML, and CSS. A noteworthy experience
                        at the company was when the CEO wanted to test what I learned.
                        He informed me about a new website they were creating called WeMeetUp that would allow people to
                        share their
                        availability during the week so that they could schedule times to meet. He wanted
                        me to create a design for the website that his designers could use as a basis to create the
                        actual website. I worked diligently to ensure the color palette, typography, and spacing
                        made sense and fit with accessibility standards. I also user-tested with my parents and siblings
                        to certify that the navigation was straightforward. After completing the Figma design, the CEO
                        and his
                        Designer viewed it and were very impressed since it was my first time designing an entire
                        website.
                        Additionally, the designers added many constructive comments on my design to help me improve.
                        This experience greatly boosted my confidence in UX/UI design and encouraged me to continue
                        exploring the field.

                        This certificate course used React Native to create a game app and a bakesale app. The course
                        demonstrated how to use React Native with Expo, iOS, and Android. The course also explained how
                        to capture mobile specific inputs including pressing, panning, and swiping. Additionally, the
                        course covered testing on multiple devices.
